        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>I’m currently pursuing my Master’s in Computer Science, now in my second semester. My academic and professional background has shaped my interest in technology, innovation, and research. I have hands-on experience in machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) through completed internships, as well as expertise in frontend and backend web development, where I’ve worked as a trainer. I am passionate about understanding how technology intersects with organizational culture and innovation, a topic I’m actively exploring in my research. When I’m not coding or researching, I enjoy delving into new areas of tech, problem-solving, and refining my technical and analytical skills. My goal is to continue developing innovative solutions and advancing my knowledge in emerging technologies. I look forward to growing academically and professionally while contributing to meaningful projects in the tech world.</p>
